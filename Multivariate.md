## Multivariate techniques for modeling single-trial EEG responses

Studying neural responses to external stimuli through EEG typically requires averaging hundrents of single-trial responses, and contrasting them at single electrode locations. We have used multivariate decoding techniques, to model single-trial EEG responses to environmental stimuli. This technique allows extracting prototypical topographies of EEG activity on the scalp in a data-driven way, and can be applied to model and study single-patient data, in cases where participant-to-participant variability is particularly high.
