## Extraction of auditory regularities

In our day-to-day lives, we are constantly immersed in streams of sensory information. Stimuli from our environment, like for example sounds, very often do not occur in a random way, but follow statistical rules and repetitive patterns. Thanks to these rules we are able to form expectations about future events, before these occur. I am interested in studying the neural and computational mechanisms that allow us to detect violations of anticipated events, in relation to our levels of [consciousness](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/138/5/1160/406045/Neural-detection-of-complex-sound-sequences-in-the), [attention](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn_a_00835?journalCode=jocn), or complexity of the environment.

In particular, in previous work we have used multivariate EEG decoding techniques to show, that patients who are deeply unconscious can detect at a neural level, violations of [simple rules](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/136/1/81/430538/Progression-of-auditory-discrimination-based-on) and [complex sound sequences](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/138/5/1160/406045/Neural-detection-of-complex-sound-sequences-in-the).
