## 1. Perception of auditory regularities

In our day-to-day lives, we are constantly immersed in streams of sensory information, like for example images or sounds. Stimuli from the environment, like for example sounds, very often do not occur in a random way, but follow statistical rules and repetitive patterns. Thanks to these rules we are able to form expectations about future events, before these occur. I am interested in studying the neural and computational mechanisms that allow us to detect violations of anticipated events, in relation to levels of [consciousness](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/138/5/1160/406045/Neural-detection-of-complex-sound-sequences-in-the), [attention](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn_a_00835?journalCode=jocn), or complexity of the environment.

In particular, in previous work we have used multivariate EEG decoding techniques to show, that patients who are deeply unconscious can detect at a neural level, violations of [simple rules](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/136/1/81/430538/Progression-of-auditory-discrimination-based-on) and [complex sound sequences](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/138/5/1160/406045/Neural-detection-of-complex-sound-sequences-in-the).

## 2. Multivariate techniques for modeling single-trial EEG responses

Studying neural responses to external stimuli through EEG typically requires averaging hundrents of single-trial responses, and contrasting them at single electrode locations. We have used multivariate decoding techniques, to model single-trial EEG responses to environmental stimuli. This technique allows extracting prototypical topographies of EEG activity on the scalp in a data-driven way, and can be applied to model and study single-patient data, in cases where participant-to-participant variability is particularly high.

## 3. Ongoing projects

* Optimizing generative models for reconstructing responses from subcortical sources, like the hippocampus and amygdala, through MEG.
* Modeling trial-by-trial changes in psychophysiological responses related to associative learning.
* Studying high-frequency oscillations through intracranial EEG recordings in epileptic patients.
