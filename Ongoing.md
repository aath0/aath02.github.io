## Ongoing projects
(under construction)

These are some of the topics I am currently working on:
### MEG source reconstruction
* Building generative models for reconstructing responses from subcortical sources, like the hippocampus and amygdala, through MEG.

### Associative learning models, inferred through responses of the autonomic nervous system
* Modeling trial-by-trial changes in psychophysiological responses related to associative learning.

### Intracranial EEG
* Studying high-frequency oscillations through intracranial EEG recordings in epileptic patients.
